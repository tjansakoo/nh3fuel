This analysis code accompanies the study titled "Environmental Implications of Green Ammonia", which investigates the environmental impacts of using green ammonia as a carbon-free fuel. The study evaluates air quality, nitrogen deposition, and climate change implications under various future emission scenarios aligned with the 1.5Â°C IPCC pathway. The data were generated using advanced atmospheric and environmental models, including GEOS-Chem, AIM-Technology, and AIM-Hub.
